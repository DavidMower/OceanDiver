## üßê Game Design <a name = "gamedesign"></a>

<br>Summary</br>
The main character is a scuba diver who wishes to search the oceans to discover and catalogue different species of aquatic life from around the world. There‚Äôre also hidden treasures to find and ocean clean-up tasks to complete.

<br>Gameplay</br>
The goal of the game is to explore different underwater environments. The player must avoid dangerous obstacles such as unexploded mines, objects falling from above and potentially dangerous aquatic life, if the player wishes to complete their catalogue and discover the hidden treasures.

<br>Mind-set</br>
Player needs to remain focused and alert to any potential dangers around them, while diving through the level exploring the environment around them.

<br>Story</br>
This game is about a scuba diver who wants to dive in different environments to see what underwater life each has to offer. The diver has been sent from a marine conservation group to document as much aquatic life as possible.
Towards the end of the game, the diver would have explored all the environments and have a catalogue containing full range of aquatic life. The catalogue contains details about each species or object which can be read as an educational element to the game.
The player can complete additional tasks such as collecting plastic garbage to clean-up the ocean and search for hidden treasure.

## üßê Technical <a name = "technical"></a>

<br>Platform</br>
Scuba Diver will be a cross-platform game supporting Microsoft Windows, Macintosh computers and Linux systems. The client‚Äôs computer would need Python installed to launch this game.

<br>Mechanics</br>
The diver has a movement speed, ranging from stopped (not moving) to swimming at full speed. The diver‚Äôs proximity to objects and aquatic life around them determines how the diver interacts. Aquatic life can be catalogued by the interact key being pressed which the diver is close enough to interact. The diver cannot swim though the aquatic life or objects within the different dive sites themselves. Colliding with these objects will cause the diver to stop moving.

The diver has health and oxygen bars, that if either reaches zero, the diver will have to start the level again. Health of the player can be lowered by certain aquatic life or objects. The diver shows damage if health is below 100%.

The diver has gold coins, treasure chests, ancient artefacts values which increase with every discovery. There‚Äôre also several plastic objects removed from the ocean.

## üßê Game Flow <a name = "gameflow"></a>

The user launches the game. The first screen will be the main menu. In the main menu there is a set of options including Start New Game, options and quit for example. Once a game has been started, it can be paused at any time and the main menu will be displayed. The level selector will be displayed first, showing a map where different levels can be selected (in any order of completion).
Each level will have unique designs along with different underwater life selected specifically for that area. These will include freshwater for River or Lake dives and marine life so ocean dives such as reef or coastal dives. Some levels will include more dangers, such as wrecks and larger aquatic life such as sharks. The player will have a diver‚Äôs log when you can log each piece of wildlife or object discovered and keep track by viewing this log at any time.
Each level will have varying amounts of plastic garbage which can be cleared. Hidden Easter eggs will be artefacts hidden within the sand to be discovered. This won‚Äôt be visible to the player, and the sand will have to be searched manually if they wish to discover the Easter eggs.
Once you start a new level, you will see the diver either next to the dive boast or at the coast where they entered the ocean. The diver can the decent to begin their dive. You control the diver, trying to avoid different harmful objects or creatures to discover the fish they wish to document. The game will indicate when danger appears by presenting a warning sign whenever a hazard or potentially dangerous creature is near the diver. If the player gets hit or attacked then the diver‚Äôs health will drop and if the players health is depleted, the player must restart the level. The player can explore all the ocean but is trying to leave the edge of the map, an indicator will pop up to tell the diver they are going too far from the boat/coast.
The player will have an oxygen level which depletes over time. The oxygen level can be restored by returning to the dive boat or beach periodically to replenish. If the oxygen level reaches zero, then the diver will die, and the level will restart.

## üßê Graphics <a name = "graphics"></a>
<br>Style Attributes</br>
Characters and environments are made up of simple 2D shapes. Each level will have a different feel in terms of the number of colours and lighting.
